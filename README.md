Steps - 

1. Open CMD
2. python -m pip install rlbot_gui rlbot eel
3. python -c "from rlbot_gui import gui; gui.start()"
4. OPTIONAL ( Make .bat file with step 3 command in it)
5. Run Step 3 and search for bot name should be (INSERT NAME) // have not named bot yet
6. Drag bot to orange and blue team
7. Run program
